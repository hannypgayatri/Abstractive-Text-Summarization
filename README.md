# Abstractive-Text-Summarization

This project is part of my final thesis, which is a requirement for completing my undergraduate studies at Sriwijaya University. The background of this project is the rapid development of technology, which has led to an increase in Indonesian news sites and a substantial surge in the availability of information. As a result, reading entire news articles can be time-consuming and challenging to receive information quickly and accurately. Therefore, a text summarization system is needed to streamline the process of extracting the core of news content efficiently. This system aims to produce informative summaries from long news texts, making it easier for readers to understand important information without having to read the entire article. Thus, it is hoped that this system will enhance time efficiency and assist users in accessing news in a more practical and speedy manner.
